# @protoyard/decks

The framework-agnostic slide deck engine for Protoyard
([ADR-038](../../docs/DECISIONS.md)). It holds everything about a deck that is
not rendering: the deck schema, the layout catalog, navigation, steps, style
resolution and quality rules. It has no Svelte and does not use Reveal.js.
[`@protoyard/decks-ui`](../decks-ui/README.md) renders it.

> **Status:** scaffolding. Today the package exports the virtual canvas sizes,
> the canvas text minimums and the aspect schema. The deck schema, layout
> catalog, navigation model, input guard, steps and motion, style resolver,
> backgrounds and quality rules land in later PLAN_005 tasks. This README
> lists only what exists.

## Exports

| Subpath | Exports |
| --- | --- |
| `@protoyard/decks` | `DECK_ASPECTS`, `DeckAspect`, `DEFAULT_DECK_ASPECT`, `isDeckAspect`, `deckCanvasSize`, `DeckCanvasSize`, `DECK_TEXT_MINIMUMS` |
| `@protoyard/decks/schema` | `DeckAspectSchema` (zod). This is where `@protoyard/blueprint`'s `kind: "deck"` branch imports the deck schema from. |

## The virtual canvas

A slide is laid out on a fixed canvas and scaled as a whole by a transform. Layouts
and lint thresholds are therefore in canvas pixels and never depend on the
viewer's screen.

| Aspect | Canvas |
| --- | --- |
| `16:9` (default) | 1280 × 720 |
| `4:3` | 1024 × 768 |
| `9:16` | 720 × 1280 |
| `1:1` | 1080 × 1080 |

`deckCanvasSize(aspect)` falls back to 16:9 for any unknown value.
`DECK_TEXT_MINIMUMS` is `{ bodyPx: 24, labelPx: 18 }`. Layout CSS and deck lint
both read it.

```ts
import { deckCanvasSize } from '@protoyard/decks';

deckCanvasSize('4:3'); // { width: 1024, height: 768 }
```

## Tests

```bash
pnpm vitest run packages/decks
pnpm --filter @protoyard/decks typecheck
```
